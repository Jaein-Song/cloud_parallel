!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!THIS PROGRAM TAKES VERY LONG TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!USE BACKGROUND OPTION FOR EXECUTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This package doesn't contain library or compiled binary.
But this package contains compiling and linking commands in shell script.
Thus, this package could be modified and added freely.

If someone would like to deliver this package to whom is not affilated NIMS or not allowed by the creater, the source code must be compiled.


The purpose of this software:
    1. Make CDF files of ceilometer and cloud radar observation.
    2. Apply quality control process to cloud radar observation.
    3. Integrate daily cloud radar observation files.
    4. Draw images of cloud radar observation

Requirement for this program:
    1. netCDF4 fortran library: libnetcdf, libnetcdff
    2. GNU fortran90 compiler (gfortran; this compiler is basically installed in almost of the linux system)
    3. NCAR Command Language (NCL): version of NCL should be higher than 6.2.1 (it may work at lower version with some warnings)
    
How to use this program:
    1. Check the list file to modify the path
    2. execute run.sh file by the command: sh run.sh
        Actually, since this code takes such a longtime, background option will be effective
        (i.e. nohup sh run.sh > log &)
